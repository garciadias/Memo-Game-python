# Memo game

## Goal:

Create a functionality to be used for a memory game application

* As consumer I can flip one card

* I can flip another card

* * If not, they go back to facing down

* * If both cards have the same symbol they stay facing up

* I can't face up more than two different cards

* When all cards are facing up the game is completed
